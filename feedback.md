## Paragraph Layout

- quite complicated to understand from scratch
- steps: 
    - create paragraph types (text, media, ...)
    - create a special paragraph with the option "Layout Paragraphs" enabled
    - create a content type with paragraph field reference (with all the paragraphs wanted into the layout paragraph checked into "Reference type" )
    - change the value of the field widget to "Layout Paragraphs" (Manage fields) and enabled "Require paragraphs to be added inside a layout" into the option of the widget
    - change the value of the field widget to "Layout Paragraphs" (Manage from display)
    
**Enjoy**
